# Cypress Code Smells

This project demonstrates several "code smells" that can occur in projects tested with Cypress, and ways to fix them.

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## Run

```bash
$ yarn serve
```

For the tests in the "impatient" folder, in another terminal you will need to run the Express server in the `/api/` folder parallel to this `/react/` folder:

```bash
$ cd ../api
$ yarn start
```

## Test

Run the dev server in another terminal, then run:

```bash
$ yarn test:e2e
```
